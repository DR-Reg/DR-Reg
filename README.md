**BSE ECE, BS Mathematics, & BS Computer Science @ Duke University**

_Focused on Hardware-Software Co-Design, Ultra-Low Latency FPGA Systems, and Computational Physics._

### 🛠️ Technical Focus 
I build systems at the intersection of mathematical rigor and physical hardware constraints.

My work spans from high-energy physics data triggers at the LHC to architecting custom SIMD accelerators for real-time rendering and sparse AI workloads.

- **FPGA / RTL**: SystemVerilog, Verilog, Vivado, Timing Closure (Artix-7), CDC Synchronization.
- **Systems**: C/C++, RISC-V/MIPS ISA, Drivers, Memory-Mapped I/O.
- **Mathematics**: Real Analysis (Measure Theory), PDEs, Dynamical Systems, Probability.

### 🔬 Research & Impact
- Duke Physics (Kotwal Lab): Optimizing real-time particle detection algorithms for the LHC. Reduced data pipeline latency by 40% through hardware-centric algorithmic redesign. 
- Duke ECE (APEX Lab): Incoming researcher under Dr. Lisa Wu Wills, exploring Domain-Specific Architectures (DSAs) for complex scientific workloads. 
- Publication: Acknowledged in [Nature](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-025-17888-0) (2024) for FPGA-optimized algorithms in HEP.
