### David Raibaut
I am David from Spain, currently studying at Duke University ('28), and I enjoy programming low level (C, asm, CUDA, GLSL), as well as high level (Java, C++, Python) and some web dev (JS/TS, Astro, React, Svelte). 
Although I have historically not put much of the work I have done on my GitHub, you can find more projects on [BitBucket](https://bitbucket.org/application-portfolio-david-raibaut/workspace/projects/PROJ), and most of my coursework is stored on GitLab.
